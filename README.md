# TDD Kata Collection

A collection of step-by-step code katas designed to learn Test-Driven Development (TDD) with incremental levels of complexity.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project provides hands-on practice with TDD using modern TypeScript, ESM modules, and contemporary testing tools. Each kata focuses on specific TDD concepts and programming fundamentals.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript with modern syntax
- **ESM** - ES6 modules for clean imports/exports
- **Vitest** - Fast and lightweight testing framework
- **ESLint** - Code linting and style enforcement
- **Node.js 24+** - Modern runtime environment

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🔄 TDD Process

Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **🔴 Red**: Write a failing test
2. **🟢 Green**: Write minimal code to make it pass
3. **🟡 Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green
4. **Repeat**: Move to the next test
